# Pelagos enemy reskin

Reskins the Pelagos enemies to be different from the base copper spitters.

## Notes
* I haven't tested how the smaller enemies look in-game. In my save file, I'm at big/behemoth evolution, and so those are the ones I've tested.
* The walking animation speed is a bit fast and it gives the enemies a "scrambling to get you" vibe, which I quite like - but feel free to adjust various parameters.
* Spawner graphics have also been changed. Sadly I couldn't get the death/decay animation to play, but the files are there if you have any ideas.
